Weakness, each with their own name, purpose, and complexity.


The LeFevre Weakness Levels




Balance Equation (Simple)
   In this formula, we use the principle of balance. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, for every strength a character has, there should be a counteracting weakness. This formula is simple and universal, applicable even to non-superpowered individuals like Batman. It can be quantified as **Strength(𝑆) = Weakness(𝑊)**. Strength and weakness are opposite sides of the same coin.


Environmental Constraint Model (Moderate)
   This formula focuses on how powers interact with the environment. For example, a character's power may be dependent on a certain condition, like Superman's powers being reliant on the yellow sun. By changing this condition, one could potentially weaken the character. This model can be presented as **Power(P) = Environmental Condition(E) + Power Source(S)**. Change the environmental condition, and you alter the power.


Quantum Vulnerability Assessment (Complex)
   This advanced formula uses principles of quantum physics to predict vulnerabilities. This formula posits that if a superpower can be explained via quantum physics, then it can also be negated or counteracted through quantum physics. It takes into account the quantum state of the superpower, and the theoretical quantum state that would counteract it. The formula can be visualized as **Vulnerability(V) = Quantum State of Superpower(QS) - Quantum Counter State(QCS)**. This formula would take into account complex variables like time, space, and energy levels.


These formulas are Dr. LeFevre's tools for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LSWs. They enable him to quantify and categorize these individuals, creating a comprehensive system for evaluating the threat posed by LSWs and the methods to counteract them.The Evolution of the Threat Assessment Formulas


The journey of Dr. Dewitt LeFevre, an acclaimed scholar, revered military officer, and a formidable leader, unfolds against the backdrop of an extraordinary global occurrence - the emergence of Living SuperWeapons (LSWs). With their incredible abilities, these LSWs carry the potential for both salvation and devastation. Driven by the need to evaluate these individuals' threats, Dewitt takes it upon himself to devise a method to do so.


**1. Power Capacity Factor (PCF):


   Dewitt's earliest encounters with LSWs drive him to measure the threat level these individuals pose based on the range, control, and intensity of their abilities. This groundwork lays the foundation for all the subsequent threat assessment models.


   **Story Beats:**


   - Introduction of Dr. Dewitt LeFevre, showcasing his military prowess and scientific brilliance.
   - Rusty Richards, a well-known LSW, foretells the appearance of more LSWs worldwide.
   - Richards' prediction comes to fruition, causing chaos and raising concerns.
   - Witnessing the catastrophe, Dewitt resolves to devise a system to assess the threat level of LSWs.
   - The Power Capacity Factor is born.


**2. Subjective Threat Assessment Model (STAM):**


   Recognizing the limitations of the PCF, which overlooked the human elements in LSWs, Dewitt incorporates aspects of their personality and motivations into his calculations. This enhancement results in a more precise and human-centric model - the STAM.


   **Story Beats:**


   - The Cuban crisis occurs, where LSWs are used as living weapons against the US.
   - Dewitt acknowledges the limitations of the PCF, which fails to predict this offensive.
   - He decides to revise the formula, incorporating personal motivations and psychological profiles.
   - The STAM is developed and tested, yielding promising results.
   - Dewitt presents STAM to the United Nations, gaining global recognition.


**3. Situational Power Assessment Matrix (SPAM):**


   Dewitt's most sophisticated model yet, the SPAM, accounts for the influence of past actions and current circumstances on the threat levels of LSWs. This dynamic model is continuously adaptive, offering a real-time threat assessment.


   




________________
The LeFevre Power Power Levels


The McLeod LeFevre Origin Threat Scale is a system that rates the threat level of living superweapons. It is used to help measure how dangerous someone with powers could be. The scale goes from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most dangerous.




Power Capacity Factor (PCF)


This formula is straightforward, focusing purely on the power itself. It multiplies the power's intensity, control, and effect range together. It's best for a quick, simple evaluation of a power's raw potential without considering the character's personality or motivations. 


- Intensity: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most intense or powerful.
- Control: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being perfect control over the power.
- Effect Range: Measured in meters, referring to the distance the power can effectively reach.


Higher scores represent greater threat levels.

FORMULA


The Power Capacity Factor (PCF) model is an arithmetic formula that calculates threat level based on three aspects: power intensity (I), power control (C), and power effect range (E).


PCF = (I x C x E) / 1000


Where:


I = Power Intensity (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most intense)
C = Power Control (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being perfect control)
E = Power Effect Range (distance in meters the power can affect)


Power Capacity Factor (PCF): Goku's power intensity (I) is massive, easily a 10. His power control (C) is also quite high, let's say 9 (he has trained for many years, but in some situations, he can lose control). His power effect range (E) is extremely large, given his ability to destroy planets. Let's place it at 10,000 meters for calculation purposes. So, PCF = (10 * 9 * 10,000) / 1000 = 900.
________________
Subjective Threat Assessment Model (STAM)


STAM goes beyond the power itself, considering the character's personality, motivations, and potential to cause harm. It assigns a weighted score to each of these factors. Use STAM when the character's psychology plays a crucial role in their threat level.


- Personality: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most volatile or unstable.
- Motivations: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most malicious or harmful.
- Potential to Cause Harm: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most harmful.


A higher score in STAM indicates a higher threat level.


FORMULA:

STAM = 0.3P + 0.4M + 0.3H


Where:


P = Personality (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most volatile)
M = Motivations (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most malicious)
H = Potential to Cause Harm (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most harmful)


Goku's personality (P) is generally good-natured, so we can assign a low rating of 2. His motivations (M) are typically to protect rather than to harm, so let's assign a 2 here as well. His potential to cause harm (H), however, is extremely high due to the sheer power he wields. This would be a 10. Therefore, STAM = 0.32 + 0.42 + 0.3*10 = 4.2.
________________
Situational Power Assessment Matrix (SPAM)


The SPAM takes a holistic approach, considering a superpower's potential in various situations (S), the user's ability to use their power under pressure (P), their past actions (A), and how much harm their power could cause in the worst-case scenario (M).
Use SPAM when the context of the power usage, including the character's history and potential for destruction, is important.


- Situational Potential: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most useful in various situations.
- Performance Under Pressure: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the best performance under pressure.
- Past Actions: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most violent or destructive past.
- Maximum Harm Potential: Rated from 1-10, with 10 being the most destructive potential.


Again, higher scores on SPAM indicate greater threat levels.

FORMULA:

The SPAM takes a holistic approach, considering a superpower's potential in various situations (S), the user's ability to use their power under pressure (P), their past actions (A), and how much harm their power could cause in the worst-case scenario (M).


SPAM = 0.2S + 0.2P + 0.3A + 0.3M


Where:


S = Situational Potential (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most useful in various situations)
P = Performance Under Pressure (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best performance under pressure)
A = Past Actions (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most violent or destructive past)
M = Maximum Harm Potential (rated from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most destructive potential)

Goku is highly versatile in many situations (S), so he gets a 10. His performance under pressure (P) is also stellar, deserving another 10. His past actions (A) have mostly been heroic, so we'll assign a 2 for low violence. His maximum harm potential (M), however, is extremely high, so he gets a 10. Therefore, SPAM = 0.210 + 0.210 + 0.32 + 0.310 = 8.6.

Notes


THREAT LEVELS






Someone who has achieved maximum human performance is assigned the Threat Level designation Alpha. This classification is given to individuals who have slightly increased strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, speed, reason, instincts, wisdom, knowledge, intellect psionic abilities, or spirituality.






Alpha's might also be more resilient to harm or have a quicker recovery time. They're a result of rigorous training, conditioning, psychological preparation, or a genetic abnormality. This label is often applied to people who have never been abducted by The Grays, and who do not possess any otherworldly genetic changes that would have occurred as a result of their abduction experience. Threat level "alpha" was given to highly trained martial artists with natural talents, as well as soilers who'd discovered their calling.














Threat Level 1 
given to those who have had at least one encounter with The Grays. They will have had one or more genetic modifications with a seemingly minor superpower.


Threat Level 2
Those who have abilities, powers, or information that exceed normal human ability are assigned a threat level 2 or deemed excellent. Such as lifting up to 800lbs, running at speeds of up to 60mph, has an eidetic memory, perfectly guessing the future, or precognition without the use of time travel through time, intensive accuracy, very minor psionic abilities, occasional misfortune Inducement














Threat Level 3
The third level in the LSW Threat System, Remarkable, is for those who usually have during their encounter with The Grays have usually been given more than a single power, ability or area of hyper knowledge abilities that exceed human capability or a single ability that is considerably more powerful than a Level 2 ability.






An example would be if they can now lift up to 2,000lbs, run at up to 80mph. They have been observed with the ability to cause trouble for local police forces with powers that national military organizations.












Threat Level 4
Level 4, Impossible, is when an individual has been granted abilities that completely break the laws of physics as they are currently understood.


Could have an eidetic memory and can now use their precognition to time-travel up to 10 minutes into the future with almost 100% accuracy. They also have some very


The fourth Threat Level designation was reserved for the volunteer LSWs who had a power that was deemed incredible. Such as being able to lift up to a to 10 tons until reaching their limit or running at speeds of up to 150mph. They also have an eidetic memory and can now use their precognition to time-travel up to 1 hour into the future with almost 100% accuracy. They also have some very




Threat Level 5The fifth and final Threat Level is for those who have
They may also have information on The Grays that could be useful to humans in the event of an encounter.




Threat Level 4 is 
Threat Level 3 is for those who have had multiple encounters with The Grays. They will have had two. 






These people may have had multiple encounters with The Grays or been abducted but have not been abducted for a prolonged period. Usually no more than two several days.














Threat level beta is given to those who have shown to possess two or more of the abilities seen in alpha-level.






Threat level beta is given to those who have been abducted by The Grays and have had their DNA  






 A person who is a danger level to the planet or reality itself is known as an Omnipotent being or power that might alter or destroy the fabric






While a somone is classified as a threat level Omnipotent entity or power that can alter or destroy the fabric of the eath or reality itself.
