## Combat System

### Initiative & Turn Order

**Initiative Formula**: `Initiative = AGL + (INS/2) + Threat_Level_Bonus + Power_Bonuses + Equipment ± Situational_Modifiers`

**Turn Sequence:**
1. **Calculate Initiative** for all combatants
2. **Highest initiative acts first**, then descending order
3. **Each character gets 3-6 Action Points (AP)** per turn based on powers
4. **Actions cost AP**: Move (1), Attack (2), Powers (3+), Items (2)

### Action Point System

**📱 Basic Actions (1-2 AP):**
- **Move**: 1 AP per square moved

### Combat Resolution
