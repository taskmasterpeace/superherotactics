---LIFTING MECHANICS---
Rule,Description,Formula
Lift_Check,STR FEAT to pick up object at your limit,Roll on Universal Table using STR column
Auto_Lift,Objects at half your limit or less,No roll required
Strain_Lift,Objects above limit but within 150%,Success required; 1 round to lift; -1CS penalty while holding
Impossible_Lift,Objects above 150% of limit,Cannot lift unless power/situation allows

---THROWING MECHANICS---
Rule,Description,Formula
Throw_Range,How far you can throw an object,STR / 10 squares (max range)
Range_Penalty,Heavier objects reduce range,Range = (STR/10) × (Max_Lift / Object_Weight)
Throw_Damage,Damage when object hits target,Object_Weight / 10 + STR bonus (if applicable)
Throw_Accuracy,Hit roll for thrown objects,MEL stat + Throwing skill bonus
Thrown_Object_Size,Affects area of impact,Small = single target; Large = 3x3 area; Huge = 5x5 area

---THROWING RANGE BY STRENGTH---
STR_Value,Max_Throw_Squares,Max_Throw_Meters,Object_Weight_Factor
1-10,1,2m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
11-20,2,4m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
21-30,3,6m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
31-40,4,8m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
41-50,5,10m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
51-75,6-7,12-14m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
76-100,8-10,16-20m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
101-150,10-15,20-30m,Can throw objects up to 1/4 lift capacity at max range
151+,15-25+,30-50m+,Cosmic throwing distances
