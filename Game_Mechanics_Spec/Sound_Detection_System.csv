===CHARACTER HEARING===
Stat,Base_Hearing_Range,Formula,Notes
INS (Instinct),INS/5 squares at 30 dB,Hearing_Range = (INS/5) × (Sound_dB/30),Higher INS = better hearing
Normal_Human,6 squares at 30 dB,Average INS 30,Standard perception
Enhanced_Hearing_Power,×2 hearing range,Double all hearing ranges,Super senses
Deaf_Status,0 hearing,Cannot hear any sounds,Status effect
Helmet/Armor,−1 to −3 squares,Reduces hearing range,Equipment penalty

===HEARING RANGE CALCULATION===
Step,Description,Formula
1,Get action's base decibels,From Sound Generation table
2,Apply material dampening,Subtract dB for walls/doors between source and listener
3,Calculate effective decibels,Effective_dB = Base_dB - Dampening
4,Calculate hearing range,Range = (INS/5) × (Effective_dB / 30)
5,Compare to distance,If distance <= Range then heard

===EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS===
Scenario,Calculation,Result
Pistol through wooden wall,140 dB - 20 dB = 120 dB effective; Range = 6 × (120/30) = 24 squares,Heard at 24 sq through wood
Running heard through brick,50 dB - 40 dB = 10 dB effective; Range = 6 × (10/30) = 2 squares,Only heard within 2 sq
Door open same room,40 dB; Range = 6 × (40/30) = 8 squares,Heard at 8 squares
Whisper through door,20 dB - 25 dB = -5 dB (cannot hear),Not heard through door

===ACTIVE LISTENING===
Action,AP_Cost,Effect,Duration,Requirements
Passive_Hearing,0,Normal hearing range,Always on,None
Active_Listen,2,+50% hearing range; identify sound type,1 turn,Cannot attack same turn
Focused_Listen,4,+100% hearing range; pinpoint location exactly,1 turn,Cannot move or attack
Sound_Identification,0,Roll INS to identify sound type,Instant,Must hear the sound

===SOUND IDENTIFICATION===
Roll_Result,Information_Gained,Examples
Failed,Know something made noise but not what,Heard something
Minor,General category of sound,Footsteps vs gunshot vs door
Success,Specific sound type and direction,Running footsteps from north
Major,Exact identification and distance estimate,Two people running 15 squares north

===SOUND CONES (UI VISUALIZATION)===
Certainty_Level,Cone_Width,Color_Code,Meaning
Exact_Location,Point,Green,Pinpointed sound source
General_Direction,45 degrees,Yellow,Know direction but not exact spot
Vague_Direction,90 degrees,Orange,Rough idea of direction
Unknown_Direction,360 degrees,Red,Heard but no direction info

===SOUND-BASED ALERTS===

Combat,Gunfire or fighting,Loud sound icon + cone,Alert + respond
Alarm,Triggered alarm system,Flashing alert,Full alert status
