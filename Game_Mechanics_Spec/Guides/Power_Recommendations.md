};
```

## POWER BALANCE NOTES

### Damage Scaling
- Weapon damage: 20-45 (pistol to sniper)
- Power damage: 30-60 (should exceed weapons slightly)
- Supers should feel powerful but not invincible

### Counter System
Every power should have at least one counter:
- Flight → Anti-air weapons, Gravity Control
- Invisibility → Enhanced Senses, Thermal Vision
- Force Field → Phasing, Mental Attacks
- Super Strength → Range (kiting), Force Fields
- Regeneration → Fire (cauterize), Disintegration

### AP Economy
- Passive powers: Free (always active)
- Toggle powers: 1-2 AP to activate/deactivate
- Active powers: 3-5 AP per use
- Powerful powers: 5+ AP, limited uses per battle

## RESOURCE & CHARGES SYSTEM

Powers and weapons need LIMITED USES to create tactical decisions.

### Ammo System (Weapons)
```javascript
const AMMO_TYPES = {
    pistol: { maxAmmo: 15, reloadAP: 2 },
    rifle: { maxAmmo: 30, reloadAP: 3 },
    smg: { maxAmmo: 40, reloadAP: 2 },
    shotgun: { maxAmmo: 8, reloadAP: 3 },
    sniper: { maxAmmo: 5, reloadAP: 4 },
    plasma_rifle: { maxAmmo: 20, reloadAP: 3 },
    beam: { maxCharges: 10, rechargeRate: 2 } // Energy recharges
};
```

### Power Charges System
```javascript
const POWER_CHARGES = {
    // Per-battle limits
    force_field: { charges: 3, recharges: false },
    teleport: { charges: 5, recharges: false },
    time_rewind: { charges: 1, recharges: false }, // VERY limited
    healing: { charges: 4, recharges: false },

    // Per-turn cooldowns
    super_punch: { cooldown: 2 }, // Every 2 turns
    psychic_blast: { cooldown: 3 },

    // Resource pool (like mana)
    energy_bolt: { energyCost: 10, maxEnergy: 100, regenPerTurn: 15 }
};
```

### How Resource System Plays

**In Combat:**
1. Player sees "AMMO: 12/30" or "CHARGES: 2/3" on unit card
2. When ammo hits 0, must spend AP to reload
3. When charges hit 0, power unavailable until next battle
4. Creates decisions: "Do I use my last teleport now or save it?"

**Tactical Depth:**
- Suppressive fire burns ammo fast
- Powers feel powerful because they're LIMITED
- Reload timing creates vulnerability windows
- Energy regeneration rewards patience

## TIME TRAVEL: COMBAT REWIND

This is actually IMPLEMENTABLE and would be unique/exciting!

### The Concept
A time traveler can REWIND combat to a previous round. Everything resets EXCEPT:
- The time traveler REMEMBERS what happened
- Player retains meta-knowledge of enemy positions/actions

### Implementation

```javascript
// Store game state at start of each turn
const TURN_HISTORY = [];

function saveTurnState() {
    TURN_HISTORY.push({
        turn: gameState.turn,
        units: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(gameState.units)), // Deep copy
        terrain: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(currentMap)),
        resources: { /* ammo, charges, etc */ }
    });
}

function timeRewind(turnsBack) {
    const targetTurn = gameState.turn - turnsBack;
    const savedState = TURN_HISTORY.find(s => s.turn === targetTurn);

    if (!savedState) return false;

    // Restore everything EXCEPT time traveler's position
    gameState.units = savedState.units;
    gameState.turn = savedState.turn;

    // Time traveler keeps current position & knowledge
    const timeTraveler = findTimeTraveler();
    timeTraveler.hasRewound = true; // Can see "future" enemy moves

    addLog(`⏪ TIME REWIND! Combat returns to Turn ${targetTurn}`, 'power');
}
```

### How It Plays

**Setup:**
- Character has "Time Rewind" power
- Limited to 1 use per battle (VERY rare)
- Can rewind 1-3 turns back

**Scenario:**
```
Turn 5: Your sniper gets killed by hidden enemy
Turn 6: You activate TIME REWIND → Go back to Turn 3
Turn 3 (again): You REMEMBER where the enemy was
         Now you can position differently, save your sniper
```

**Balance Considerations:**
- Only 1 charge per battle (max 2 for powerful time travelers)
- Cannot rewind past the point time traveler entered combat
- Costs ALL remaining AP when used
- Other units don't remember (only time traveler)
- Enemy AI doesn't adapt (same decisions unless provoked differently)

### Time Traveler Unit Example
```javascript
const TIME_TRAVELER = {
    name: "Chronos",
    origin: "cosmic",
    powers: {
        time_rewind: {
            charges: 1,
            maxTurnsBack: 3,
            apCost: "ALL",
            effect: "Reset combat to previous turn. You retain knowledge."
        },
        time_sense: {
            passive: true,
            effect: "+2CS dodge (sees attacks coming)"
        },
        temporal_shift: {
            charges: 3,
            effect: "Phase out of time for 1 turn (invulnerable, can't act)"
        }
    }
};
```

### Why This Works
1. **Strategic depth** - "Do I waste my ONE rewind now?"
2. **Dramatic moments** - Undoing a catastrophic mistake
3. **Knowledge advantage** - You know where enemies will be
4. **Limited power** - One use keeps it balanced
5. **Counter-play** - Other time sensitives might resist rewind

---

## OTHER "BROKEN" POWERS MADE TACTICAL

### Probability Manipulation
Instead of affecting ALL rolls, make it targeted:
```javascript
probability_twist: {
    charges: 3,
    effect: "Force reroll on next attack (yours or enemy's)",
    apCost: 1 // Reaction ability
}
```

### Precognition
Limited "peek" at enemy intentions:
```javascript
precognition: {
    charges: 2,
    effect: "See enemy's planned action for next turn",
    apCost: 2
}
```

### Dimensional Shift
Escape but with drawbacks:
```javascript
dimensional_escape: {
    charges: 1,
    effect: "Remove self from battle for 3 turns. Return at same spot.",
    note: "Cannot attack while shifted. Enemies can wait for return."
}
```

---

## WHAT NOT TO IMPLEMENT

### Game-Breaking Powers (No Limited Version Works)
- **Reality Warping** - No reasonable counter even with limits
- **Omniscience** - Removes fog of war entirely
- **Immortality** - Can't be defeated
- **Power Mimicry** - Would need to copy any power (too complex)
- **Possession** - Takes over other units (removes player agency)

### Narrative-Only Powers
- **Longevity** - No combat effect
- **Life Support** - Environmental only
- **Animal Communication** - No tactical animals
