# Injury System Guide

## Overview

The Injury System adds meaningful consequences to combat beyond simple HP loss. When triggered, characters roll d100 on the injury table to determine specific wounds ranging from fatal injuries to lucky survivability outcomes.

---

## When Do Injuries Occur?

Injuries are triggered by specific combat events:

| Trigger | Roll Modifier | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Major Success Against You | +0 | Enemy rolls 98-100 on attack |
| Critical Hit | +0 | Natural critical with weapon |
| Overkill Damage | -20 | Single hit exceeds your max HP |
| Called Shot Success | -30 | Targeted attack hits specific body part |
| Falling Damage | -10 per 10ft | Fall from height |
| Explosion | +10 | Caught in blast radius |
| Crushing | -15 | Crushed by heavy object |

**Lower rolls = worse injuries. Higher rolls = better outcomes.**

## Injury Categories

| Category | d100 Roll | Severity | Recovery |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Fatal | 1 | Death | Resurrection only |
| Permanent Disability | 2-9 | Lose body part | Regenerate/Prosthetic |
| Critical Injury | 10-18 | Life-threatening | Magical healing |
| Severe Injury | 19-35 | Major wound | Weeks to heal |
| Moderate Injury | 36-55 | Significant wound | Days to heal |
| Minor Injury | 56-75 | Temporary impairment | Days to heal |
| Light Injury | 76-91 | Brief impairment | Rest to heal |
| Memorable Scars | 92-93 | Battle mark | Permanent (cosmetic) |
| Survivability | 94-100 | Lucky break | Beneficial! |

| 9 | Lose Foot | Half movement speed | Regenerate/Prosthetic |

### Critical Injuries (Rolls 10-18)

| Roll | Injury | Effect | Duration |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 12 | Ruptured Aorta | -2CS death saves, auto-fail one | Until stable |
| 15 | Broken Spine | Concentration check every turn | 2d8 weeks |
| 16 | Severed Muscles | -2CS STR checks/attacks | 2d8 weeks |

### Severe Injuries (Rolls 19-35)

| Roll | Injury | Effect | Duration |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 18-19 | Broken Arm/Leg | Limb unusable or half movement | 2d8 weeks |
| 20 | Internal Bleeding | Attack/dash = 1d6 self-damage | 2d8 weeks |
| 21 | Punctured Lung | Concentration DC10 every turn | 2d8 weeks |
| 25 | Severe Concussion | CON check or fall prone on attack | 2d6 days |

### Survivability Outcomes (Rolls 94-100)

| Roll | Outcome | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| 94-95 | Exaggerated Wound | +1CS next attack or save |
| 96-97 | Second Wind | Intimidation advantage |
| 98-99 | Unexpected KO | Enemies ignore you (assumed dead) |
| 100 | Adrenaline Rush | Instant stabilize + heal |

## Injury Resistance

Some factors improve your injury roll (higher = better):

| Source | Modifier | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Durability Power | +20 | Superhuman resilience |
| Armor DR | +1 per 5 DR | Armor absorbs impact |
| Shield Block | +30 | If attack was blocked |
| Defensive Stance | +10 | Prepared for impact |
| Regeneration | Auto-cure | Injuries heal between combats |

**Example**: A character with DR 15 armor (+3) in Defensive Stance (+10) who blocks with a shield (+30) adds +43 to their injury roll!

## Medical Treatment

### Field Treatment

| Treatment | Effect | Time | Check |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| First Aid | Stabilize, stop bleeding | 2 AP | Medicine DC10 |
| Field Surgery | Halve recovery time | 10 min | Medicine DC15 |

### Professional Care

| Treatment | Effect | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Hospital Care | 1/4 recovery time | Requires medical facility |
| Magical Healing | Instant cure (moderate/minor) | Powers or items |
| Regenerate | Cure permanent disabilities | Rare power/spell |
| Clone Replacement | Full recovery | Technology + high cost |

---

## Recovery Times

| Injury Category | Untreated | With Treatment | Hospital |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Critical | Until stable | Magical healing | 1 week |
| Severe | 2d8 weeks | 1d8 weeks | 1d4 weeks |
| Moderate | 2d6 days | 1d6 days | 1d3 days |
| Minor | 1d4 days | 1d2 days | 1 day |
| Light | Long rest | Short rest | Immediate |

## Prosthetics

For permanent disabilities, prosthetics offer alternatives to Regenerate:

### Basic Prosthetics (Low Cost)
- **Wooden Leg**: 50% movement, cannot run
- **Hook Hand**: Cannot use two-handed, -1CS manipulation

### Modern Prosthetics (Medium Cost)
- **Prosthetic Leg**: 75% movement, can jog
- **Prosthetic Arm**: Basic function, -1CS fine manipulation

### Cybernetic Prosthetics (High Cost)
- **Cyber Leg**: 100% movement + 5 bonus squares
- **Cyber Arm**: Full function + 1CS STR bonus
- **Cyber Eye**: Full function + 1CS perception (may include zoom/IR)

## Example: Injury Resolution

**Scenario**: Hero takes a Major Success hit from a rifle.

1. **Trigger**: Major Success (98-100 roll) triggers injury check
2. **Roll Modifiers**:
   - Hero has DR 10 armor: +2
   - Hero in Defensive Stance: +10
   - Total: +12
3. **Roll**: d100 = 23
4. **Modified Roll**: 23 + 12 = 35
5. **Result**: Roll 35 = "Mild Concussion"
   - Effect: INT check or flee combat
   - Duration: 1d4 days
   - Cure: First Aid

Without the armor and stance, the raw roll of 23 would have been "Ruptured Liver" - a much worse outcome!

---

## Called Shots (Optional Rule)

Players can attempt called shots to target specific body parts:

1. Declare called shot and target (head, arm, leg, etc.)
2. Attack at -2CS penalty
3. On hit, target's injury roll gets -30 modifier
4. Injury result relates to targeted area

**Risk/Reward**: Called shots are harder to land but more likely to cause specific disabilities.

---

## Designer Notes

- **Purpose**: Injuries add weight to combat decisions without making every fight crippling
- **Survivability Rolls**: High rolls (94-100) reward luck and create heroic moments
- **Permanent Disabilities**: Require investment to cure, creating resource management
- **Medical Economy**: Healing powers become valuable, encouraging team composition
- **Clone System**: Ultimate fallback at high cost, preventing permanent character loss
- **Prosthetics**: Integration with technology tree, cybernetics as enhancement path
