---PENETRATION AND CONTINUATION SYSTEM---,Rules for attacks passing through obstacles and continuing to additional targets

===CORE FORMULA===

===DESIGNER NOTES===
Topic,Note
Balance_Intent,Standard weapons should NOT penetrate standard cover (brick; car doors)
AP_Ammo_Tradeoff,Better penetration but reduced damage to soft targets; tactical choice
Super_Strength_Fantasy,STR 80+ throwing cars through walls IS the intended experience
Natural_Damage_Falloff,Multiple penetrations naturally reduce damage; prevents infinite chains
Narrative_Override,GM can adjust obstacle HP for dramatic moments
Psychic_Exception,Mental attacks bypass ALL physical cover; balanced by range/shields
