Throwing_Strength_Requirements,Strength Scaling,Objects require minimum strength to throw effectively,Strength requirement calculated as Object_Weight / 100 (minimum),Characters below strength requirement cannot throw object effectively,Strength determines throwing effectiveness and range,Higher strength allows for heavier objects and greater range
Throwing_Range_Calculation,Range Mechanics,Throwing range based on strength and object weight,"Base_Range = (Character_STR - Object_Weight/50) × Range_Modifier",Heavier objects require more strength for same range,Range decreases as object weight approaches strength limit,Maximum range achieved when strength greatly exceeds object weight
Throwing_Accuracy_Penalties,Accuracy Mechanics,Heavier objects harder to throw accurately,Accuracy penalty increases with object weight relative to thrower strength,Very heavy objects get significant accuracy penalties,Accuracy penalties range from +1CS (light) to -5CS (maximum weight),Perfect accuracy requires strength significantly exceeding object weight
Throwing_Damage_Scaling,Damage Mechanics,Thrown object damage enhanced by thrower strength,Damage increases with thrower strength beyond base object damage,"Thrown_Damage = Object_Base_Damage + (STR_Bonus/5)",High strength characters make improvised weapons devastatingly effective,Thrown objects become more dangerous with stronger throwers

Environmental_Availability_Residential,Location Availability,Objects found in residential areas,Furniture; appliances; personal vehicles; garden equipment,Moderate availability with personal property implications,Suburban combat has moderate throwing options with legal complications,Homes provide throwing options but with personal property legal issues
Environmental_Availability_Natural,Location Availability,Objects found in natural environments,Trees; rocks; boulders; natural materials,Limited but no legal ownership issues,Nature combat has fewer but legally safer throwing options,Wilderness provides natural throwing weapons without legal complications
Environmental_Availability_Government,Location Availability,Objects found in government facilities,Office furniture; government vehicles; security equipment; classified materials,High legal consequences for destruction,Government building combat has severe legal implications for throwing,Official buildings provide throwing options with maximum legal consequences
Environmental_Availability_Military,Location Availability,Objects found on military bases,Military vehicles; weapons; equipment; classified technology,Ultimate legal and security consequences,Military base combat has ultimate legal implications,Military facilities provide military-grade throwing weapons with ultimate consequences
Legal_Consequences_Personal_Property,Legal Framework,Destruction of privately owned objects,Theft and destruction of personal property charges,Property value determines charge severity,Personal items create theft charges in addition to destruction,Low-value personal property results in misdemeanor charges
Legal_Consequences_Public_Property,Legal Framework,Destruction of government owned objects,Vandalism and destruction of public property,Public property destruction affects government services,Government property creates federal charges,Public property destruction often results in federal prosecution
Legal_Consequences_Commercial_Property,Legal Framework,Destruction of business owned objects,Business property destruction and lost revenue,Business disruption affects livelihoods,Commercial destruction creates civil liability,Business property destruction creates both criminal and civil liability
Legal_Consequences_Emergency_Equipment,Legal Framework,Destruction of emergency service equipment,Interference with emergency services and public safety,Emergency equipment affects life safety services,Emergency service disruption creates maximum criminal liability,Emergency equipment destruction often results in terrorism charges
Legal_Consequences_Infrastructure,Legal Framework,Destruction of utility and infrastructure,Infrastructure destruction affecting essential services,Utility destruction affects entire communities,Infrastructure damage creates federal terrorism charges,Infrastructure destruction treated as domestic terrorism
Legal_Consequences_Cultural_Property,Legal Framework,Destruction of culturally significant objects,Cultural heritage destruction and community impact,Cultural items have significance beyond monetary value,Cultural destruction creates hate crime enhancements,Cultural property destruction may result in federal hate crime charges
