# SuperHero Tactics - Complete Education System Guide

## Introduction and Philosophy

Welcome to the complete guide for the SuperHero Tactics education system. This is not just a skill tree or a simple training mechanic. This is a full-blown university and career development system that fundamentally changes how you build and develop your characters. Think of it as one of the major power systems in the game, right alongside your origin powers and your equipment loadouts.

The core philosophy here is simple: education opens doors. Without the right credentials, certain equipment is locked away from you. Without the proper training, you cannot perform certain actions. Without the appropriate degrees, the best jobs and cover identities remain out of reach. Your character might have superhuman strength, but if they want to perform surgery on a wounded teammate, they better have gone to medical school.

This system was designed to feel like flipping through a university catalog. You browse fields of study, pick your specializations, choose where you want to study, and then commit your time to actually learning. It is compressed for gameplay purposes, so one month of uninterrupted study gets you a Bachelor's degree equivalent, but the depth and the choices are all there.

## The Three Educational Tracks

There are three distinct pathways through the education system, and each one has its own progression, its own flavor, and its own set of opportunities.

### The Academic Track

The academic track is your traditional university education. This is for the intellectuals, the researchers, the doctors and scientists. If you want letters after your name, this is where you go.

The progression goes like this: You start with an Associate degree, which takes about two weeks of study. This gives you the basics, the fundamentals. From there you move to a Bachelor's degree, which is another four weeks. This is where most people stop in the real world, and it opens up the majority of professional jobs and equipment.

But you can keep going. A Master's degree takes another three weeks and marks you as a specialist in your field. Then comes the Doctorate at six weeks, which is the pinnacle for most fields. You become Doctor Whatever, you can teach others, you get access to classified and experimental equipment. And for the truly dedicated, there is the Post-Doctorate, another four weeks, which represents cutting-edge research and the absolute elite of academia.

Each level grants stat bonuses to your primary attribute for that field. An Associate gives plus one, a Bachelor plus two, all the way up to plus five for a Post-Doc. You also earn skill points at each level that can be spent on abilities related to your field.

### The Vocational Track

The vocational track is for the practical people. The mechanics, the technicians, the craftsmen. These are the people who actually know how to do things with their hands. While the academics are writing papers about robotics theory, the vocational graduates are the ones actually building and repairing the robots.

This track is faster than academic, but it maxes out at a lower tier. You start with a Certificate, just one week of training. This proves you have basic competency. Next is a Diploma at two weeks, showing you have solid foundational skills. Then comes the Trade License at three weeks, which legally certifies you to perform professional work in your field. Finally, there is Master Craftsman at four weeks, which represents true mastery of a trade.

Vocational education is perfect for characters who need practical skills quickly. A certificate in weapons systems and suddenly you can maintain and repair firearms. A trade license in vehicle engineering and you can professionally modify cars. Master Craftsman in electronics and you are the go-to person for any technical problem.

### The Military and Intelligence Track

The third track is military and intelligence training. This is boot camp, advanced warfare schools, spy academies, and special forces programs. If you want to be a professional soldier or operative, this is your path.

It starts with Basic Training, two weeks that teach you the fundamentals of military discipline, weapons handling, and squad operations. Advanced Training takes another three weeks and covers more sophisticated tactics and specialized combat skills. Specialist training at four weeks makes you an expert in a particular area of warfare. Elite training, also four weeks, puts you among the best of the best. And finally, Command training at six weeks prepares you to lead others in combat operations.

This track is particularly valuable because it unlocks military-grade equipment and provides access to military facilities and intelligence networks. A character with Command level training in military tactics can requisition serious hardware and has contacts throughout the defense establishment.

### Tier Two - Basic Institutions

Basic institutions are affordable options for those on a budget. They cost thirty percent less but take twenty-five percent longer, operating at fifty-five percent effectiveness. These are trade schools, community colleges, and correspondence programs.

Shaolin Temple in China is an exception to the typical tier two institution. It specializes in Martial Arts, Temple Training, and Spirit Communion. Belt advancement is at plus one tier for Shaolin students. Despite being tier two in general academics, Shaolin is the premier martial arts institution in the world.

Vatican Academy in Vatican City specializes in Occult Investigation, Divine Connection, and Arcane Studies. It provides exorcism certification. This is where you go to fight demons and understand the supernatural from a religious perspective.

Generic Trade School represents any vocational training center. These provide practical skills efficiently without the frills of higher education.

Generic Community College represents accessible higher education options available in most areas.

### Tier One - Home Base

Tier one represents learning at your own base of operations. This costs only materials, no tuition, but takes fifty percent longer and operates at only forty percent effectiveness.

Home Base Training means using your own facilities to learn. This is slow and not ideal, but it is private and does not require travel. If you have downtime at base and cannot get to a real school, you can still make progress.

Online Learning is available anywhere with internet access. It takes forty percent longer than standard and operates at fifty percent effectiveness. The advantage is you can study from anywhere in the world. Some fields cannot be studied online because they require hands-on practice.

## The Day Jobs System

Day jobs serve two purposes in SuperHero Tactics. First, they provide income. Second, and more importantly, they provide cover. A superhero needs to explain where their money comes from and have a reason to be in certain places. A day job provides both.

### Entry Level Jobs (No Education Required)

Janitor pays five hundred dollars per week and requires forty or more hours. The cover benefit is access to buildings after hours. You have keys and security codes for wherever you work. Nobody pays attention to the janitor.

Construction Laborer pays seven hundred dollars per week and requires forty-five hours. The cover benefit is physical fitness justification and site access. If you are visibly strong, being a construction worker explains it.

Fast Food Worker pays four hundred fifty dollars per week and requires thirty-five hours. The cover benefit is flexible hours and being forgettable. Nobody remembers the person behind the counter.

### Certificate Level Jobs

## Study Mechanics

Actually pursuing education involves study sessions, time management, and the risk of failure.

### Study Session Types

Full Study is eight hours and provides one hundred percent learning rate. It requires being at an institution or home base with no other activities.

Part-Time Study is four hours and provides forty percent learning rate. It can be combined with a job in the same day.

Intensive Study is twelve hours and provides one hundred eighty percent learning rate. However, it risks exhaustion and drains morale. Use this sparingly when you need to cram.

Online Study is six hours and provides sixty percent learning rate. It only requires internet access and can be done anywhere. Some fields requiring hands-on practice cannot be studied online.

Practical Lab is eight hours and provides one hundred twenty percent learning rate. It requires facility access and equipment but is more effective than regular study for technical and scientific fields.

### Weekly Requirements

To maintain normal progress toward a degree, you need three full study sessions per week. Two sessions per week gives you seventy-five percent progress with no dropout risk. One session per week gives you fifty percent progress but adds five percent dropout risk. Zero sessions freezes your progress and adds fifteen percent dropout risk.

### The Exam System

Major exams occur at every twenty-five percent of degree completion. So you take exams at twenty-five, fifty, seventy-five, and one hundred percent progress. Each exam involves a roll combining your primary stat plus a bonus from study hours against the exam difficulty.

A passing result lets you continue normally. A failure requires a retake that adds one week to your timeline. A critical failure triggers dropout risk evaluation and may force you to leave the program.

### Dropout Risk

Several factors increase your risk of dropping out. Having your primary stat below the minimum for the field adds fifteen percent risk for every ten points you are below. Missing three or more consecutive study sessions adds ten percent cumulative risk. Each failed exam adds five percent. Having morale below thirty adds twenty percent. Having stress above eighty adds twenty-five percent. Suffering a combat injury while studying adds ten percent.

If you drop out, you lose fifty percent of your progress toward the current degree. You retain all completed degrees and certifications. There is a six-month cooldown before you can re-enroll at the same institution. You can transfer to a lower-tier institution immediately.

---

## Learning Speed Formula

How fast you learn depends on your stats, your institution, and whether you are studying online.

The formula is: Base Time multiplied by one hundred divided by your primary stat plus twenty, multiplied by the institution's location modifier, multiplied by the online modifier if applicable.

So if you have a primary stat of eighty, you divide one hundred by one hundred, getting one. You learn at normal speed. If your primary stat is only forty, you divide one hundred by sixty, getting about one point six seven. You learn sixty-seven percent slower.

The institution modifier then applies. Elite institutions multiply by zero point seven five, meaning you finish twenty-five percent faster. Basic institutions multiply by one point two five, meaning you finish twenty-five percent slower.

Finally, if you are studying online, multiply by one point four, adding forty percent to your time.

A character with Intelligence eighty studying at MIT would calculate: base time times one times zero point seven five equals seventy-five percent of the listed time.

A character with Intelligence forty studying online at a basic institution would calculate: base time times one point six seven times one point two five times one point four equals about two point nine two times the listed time.

Stats matter enormously for education speed.

## Integration with Other Game Systems

The education system does not exist in isolation. It connects to nearly every other system in the game.

### City Types

Educational cities provide a plus one tier bonus to all institutions located there. Military cities provide bonuses to military track programs. Industrial cities provide bonuses to trade and technical education. Temple cities make occult and spiritual training available.

### Country Statistics

A country's higher education rating affects what institution tiers are available there. A country's science rating affects whether super-science programs are available. Military services affects the quality of military academies. Government corruption affects whether criminal schools operate openly.

### Character Status

The training status indicates your character is actively studying. Personal life status allows online study while resting. Hospital status prevents any study. Investigation status gives bonuses to relevant study, like learning investigation techniques while actively working a case.

### Origin Interactions

Spiritual Enhancement is the only origin that can access Occult and Mystical studies without special circumstances.

Robotic characters get a twenty percent bonus to Technical and Engineering education. They understand machines intuitively.

Altered and Mutated humans get a ten percent bonus to Life Sciences education. They have personal experience with biological changes.

Tech Enhancement characters have prerequisites waived for cybernetics programs. They already have implants and understand the technology.

---

## Strategic Considerations

Education is a long-term investment. A character who spends two months getting a doctorate is not available for missions during that time, but they emerge with permanent stat bonuses, new abilities, and access to equipment and jobs that would otherwise be locked.

Consider your team composition. You probably want at least one character with medical training so you can treat injuries effectively. Someone with technical skills can maintain and repair equipment. Someone with investigation or tradecraft training can gather intelligence. Someone with combat training can lead tactical operations.

Cover identities become important in the mid-game. Having a legitimate job explains your income, gives you access to facilities, and reduces suspicion. A doctor can access any hospital. An IT technician can access any computer system. A security consultant can case any building.

The restricted fields are powerful but require investment to access. Super-science unlocks the most advanced technology in the game, but you need an Intelligence of seventy plus an existing science degree plus facility access. Occult studies provide unique capabilities against supernatural threats but require the right origin or sponsorship. Criminal education opens up illegal options but requires underworld connections.

Balance immediate needs against long-term development. Sometimes you need a character available now and cannot spare them for months of education. Sometimes the mission requires capabilities you do not have, and education is the only way to get them.

---

## Example Education Paths

Here are some example character builds using the education system.

### The Combat Medic

Start with the Former Military background for basic training. Get an associate degree in combat medicine from West Point, specializing in field medic. Then get a bachelor's in medicine from Johns Hopkins, specializing in surgery. Now you can fight effectively and save lives. Take a job as an EMT for cover and access to medical facilities.

### The Technical Specialist

Start with the Trade Worker background for a trade license in electronics. Get a bachelor's in robotics from MIT, specializing in utility bots. Get a master's in hacking from Stanford, specializing in penetration testing. Now you can build surveillance drones and hack into systems. Take a job as a security consultant for cover and client access.

### The Intelligence Operative

Start with the Intelligence Asset background for advanced tradecraft. Get a master's in languages from Oxford, learning three language families. Get training in interrogation from Langley, specializing in psychological pressure. Now you can operate undercover anywhere, speak to anyone, and extract information from targets. Take a job as a security consultant or remain with your agency.

### The Scientist Hero

Start with the Academia background for a random master's degree. Get a doctorate in genetics from MIT. Then access super-science through a research facility and study power augmentation. Now you can enhance your own abilities and those of your teammates. Take a job as a research scientist for cover and lab access.

### The Street-Level Vigilante

Start with the Street Smart background for criminal contacts. Access underground criminal education and get training in safecracking and black market operations. Get a certificate in martial arts from a local dojo, specializing in striking arts. Now you can fight, break into anywhere, and access illegal equipment. Work as a bouncer or take no legitimate job at all.

---

## Conclusion

The education system in SuperHero Tactics transforms character development from a simple experience point expenditure into a meaningful set of choices about who your character is and what they can do. Every degree opens new doors. Every specialization provides unique capabilities. Every institution choice affects your learning experience.

Your character's education becomes part of their identity. The MIT robotics graduate thinks differently than the Shaolin martial artist. The Johns Hopkins surgeon has different capabilities than the street-smart criminal. These differences matter in gameplay, in roleplay, and in the stories you tell.

Take the time to plan your characters' educational paths. Consider what you need for your current mission and what you want for the future. Remember that education takes time away from active operations but provides permanent benefits that cannot be obtained any other way.

Welcome to the university of superhero tactics. Class is in session.
