- Special considerations:
  - East Asian names (Culture 6): Family name comes first
  - Middle Eastern leaders: Used appropriate titles (Al-, bin, etc.)
  - Gulf states: Used royal family names (Al-Sabah, Al-Maktoum, etc.)
  - Former French colonies: French-influenced names
  - All names are fictional
